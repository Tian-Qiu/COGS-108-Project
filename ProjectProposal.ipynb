    "This project is aimed at finding the secret recipe for creating trending videos on YouTube. According to [the latest traffic report](https://www.similarweb.com/website/youtube.com), YouTube is the world's second largest search engine with 25.42 billion total visits within the last month (28 days). As one of the most popular Art & Entertainment content-providing systems, YouTube spans across cultures and nations, with its trending videos viewed by a wide range of audiences around the globe. Thus, learning about characteristics of trending YouTube videos supports the design and evaluation of personalization services, from precise advertising to recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trending videos on youtube range from anticipated movie trailers to hilarious talk show interviews all the way down to home videos of a young boy yodeling in Walmart.  YouTube has said that Trending aims to showcase videos that are appealing to a wide audience and exhibit what’s happening on YouTube and to a certain extent what’s happening around the world.  This list of trending videos is the same for all users in each country, with an exception in India.  Since Trending isn’t personalized and is the same for all users, it is a great list for YouTube creators to be on as it gives their video more chances of being watched.  So how does one get their video on Trending?\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, it’s crucial to note that YouTube has said that Trending videos aren’t necessarily the top viewed videos at the time. This opens up the opportunity to look at more than just video views, such as a video’s age, category, growth rate, title, tags, description, etc. to identify (if any) the common factors of videos on Trending.  We believe that there will be common factors, and by identifying them, YouTube creators can alter their videos to fit these factors to increase their chances of getting on Trending.  Furthermore, it’s important to ask if being on Trending actually increases video views, as creators don’t want their video views to become stagnant.  We hypothesize that trending videos with a quick popularity spike tend to stay popular longer.  We will analyze this by considering the duration between the upload and trending date.  The momentum of popularity will increase as the video gets more views and it will further increase the video's popularity.  From an eye-catching title to a special tag or an interesting description, features in this dataset might be able to determine the \"trendiness\", which help us to better understand human behavior in a cyberworld.\n",

    "In Cheng's paper, researchers examined YouTube's unique traffic patterns and investigated the socoal network of videos. By analyzing 3 million videos crawled within a 4 month window, they discovered that YouTube videos exhibit the ['Small-World Phenomenon'](https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/travers69smallworld.pdf) that YouTube videos can be grouped by some large clustering coefficients and have a short characteristic path length linking other videos within the cluster. The paper implies that a trending video might increase other videos' popularity from its cluster. The assumption that trending videos are also clustered is important because the underlying connections between similar trending videos might also be the contributing factor of popularity.\n",

    "Our data are relatively clean, and most of the data cleaning work should be done to the text section, in our case, the title and video description. Non-ascii characters, emojis, and URLs will be removed to help us understand the content of the video better. We also see some videos that have blank tag, and those videos should either be dropped or have their field fill with some default value. The dataset also has a filed indicating if the video has been removed, and those videos should be dropped or studied separately because there could be abnormal cases (e.g. violation of copy rights or inappropriate contents).\n",

    "We plan to use T-test and linear/logistic regression to help us analyze our Youtube dataset. Before running our rests, we will visualize the data and check the data distribution and come up with some threshould as our metric of evaluation if necessary. T-test is used to verify our hypothesis about the factors that have positive impact on trending. For example, our hypothesis may be trending has some positive relationship with the number of views of a video. If we get high confidence (e.g. 90% ~ 95%), then our hypotheis is resonable. Otherwise, we would need to find some other factors that might affect trending. Another technique is clustering, we want to understand whether popular videos can be divided into groups that share similar features, and how do features of groups of video varies. Since the dataset already has category labels, we probably will use this technique to further understand the features of popular video given a specific category.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also like to perform content-based analysis to see what kind of title or video description are most attractive to viewers. We plan to perform this analysis by category and possibly for all data as well. To do this, we will need to use bag-of-word model to count most common words while removing all stopwords (by having a stopword list or use tf-idf weight). Then, we will visualize the data and see what kind of keyword distribution the text data have. If we have time, we can also explore how those keywords change over time.\n",

    "If our analysis and hypotheses are correct and we find that there are commonalities in the features of videos on Trending and that videos with quicker popularity spikes gain the most momentum, it could potentially change the structure of how YouTube creators and companies make and describe their videos.  These creators can make better titles, tags, descriptions, etc. for their videos by basing them off of the common characteristics of Trending videos to better their chances of getting on the Trending page.  Furthermore by increasing their chances of getting their video on Trending they are simultaneously increasing the likelihood of getting on Trending sooner, which will help their video gain more momentum.  Overall this will help their video to continue gaining views instead of going stagnant.  While this is important for general YouTube creators, this insight would be extremely useful for companies as it would give them advertising advantages.  They can create specific types of videos based off of Trending video characteristics to increase their chances of being on Trending and reaching wider audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if it turns out that there is no correlation between how quick a YouTube video ends up on Trending and its overall success in terms of views, it will lead us to look more into the other characteristics of videos on Trending such as likes and dislikes.  For instance a video might gain popularity quickly and end up on Trending, but get a lot of dislikes.  Even though the video gained fast popularity, it wasn’t received well which made people stop watching it.  Therefore we would analyze this concept of viewer reception by further analyzing likes and dislikes for videos that gained quick popularity if our hypothesis turns out to be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential pitfall that might cause a problem in our interpretation is that we’re only analyzing videos that have ended up on Trending, which is only a small portion if we compare it to the huge amount of videos on YouTube.  If there are in fact common characteristics of Trending videos, how many videos on the platform also share those characteristics but didn’t end up on Trending and why?  This could be a downfall in our analysis depending on the amount of videos that do have those characteristics but didn’t end up on Trending.  This would show that there is something else involved with a video ending up on Trending.  One such thing could be a video’s thumbnail.  Our dataset doesn’t include the video thumbnail which might be a factor in why people choose to watch a video in the first place."
